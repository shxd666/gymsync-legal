        <h1>GymSync Terms of Use</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: May 21, 2024</strong> <!-- UPDATE THIS DATE --> </p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the GymSync application ("App"), including any services offered through it such as access to personalized coaching, you ("User," "You") agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App or its services. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and GymSync ("We," "Us," "Our").</p>

        <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>To use certain features of the App, you must register for an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete. You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
        <p>Users must be at least 13 years old, or such higher age required in your country, to use the App. If you are under 18, you represent that your legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>3. Fitness and Health Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The App provides fitness tracking, workout planning, nutrition management tools, and access to coaching services for informational and educational purposes only. THE INFORMATION AND SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH THE APP, INCLUDING ANY ADVICE OR PLANS FROM COACHES, DO NOT CONSTITUTE MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, OR TREATMENT. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or before starting any new fitness regimen or making changes to your diet. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read or received through the App. Your use of the App and any information or services provided, including coaching, is solely at your own risk. GymSync and its affiliated coaches are not liable for any injuries, health issues, or damages that may result from your use of the App or reliance on its content or services.</p>

        <h2>4. Coaching Services & Payments</h2>
        <p>GymSync may facilitate access to independent fitness and nutrition coaches ("Coaches"). When you choose to engage a Coach through the App, you are entering into an agreement directly with that Coach for their services, facilitated by GymSync.</p>
        <p><strong>Fees:</strong> Fees for coaching services are set by the Coaches (in agreement with GymSync) and displayed on their profiles. You agree to pay all applicable fees for the coaching services you select. All payments are processed through our third-party payment processor, Paddle.com. By making a payment, you agree to Paddle's terms and conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> All payments made by Users for coaching services are collected by GymSync on behalf of the Coaches. GymSync will retain a service fee (commission) from the amount paid by the User, and the remaining balance will be due to the Coach. The specific commission rate will be as agreed between GymSync and the Coach.</p>
        <p><strong>Payouts to Coaches:</strong> GymSync will remit the Coach's portion of the fees according to a separate agreement and payout schedule established with each Coach. Coaches are responsible for providing accurate payout information and for any taxes associated with their earnings.</p>
        <p><strong>No Refunds:</strong> Unless otherwise required by applicable law or explicitly stated by GymSync or the Coach, all fees for coaching services are non-refundable.</p>
        <p><strong>Coach-User Relationship:</strong> GymSync acts as a platform to connect Users with Coaches. While we may vet Coaches, we are not responsible for the specific advice, quality of service, or outcomes provided by individual Coaches. Any disputes regarding coaching services should primarily be addressed between the User and the Coach, though GymSync may offer mediation assistance at its discretion.</p>

        <h2>5. User Content</h2>
        <p>You may create or upload content to the App, including workout routines, meal logs, custom food and exercise entries, progress photos, and communications with coaches ("User Content"). You retain all ownership rights to your User Content. However, by submitting User Content, you grant GymSync a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform your User Content in connection with the App and GymSync's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including for promoting and redistributing part or all of the App.</p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it. You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to publish User Content you submit.</p>

        <h2>6. Prohibited Activities</h2>
        <p>You agree not to engage in any of_the following prohibited activities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using the App for any illegal purpose or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law.</li>
            <li>Harassing, abusing, or harming another person, including Coaches and other Users.</li>
            <li>Posting User Content that is unlawful, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, offensive, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
            <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to the App, other user accounts, or computer systems or networks connected to the App.</li>
            <li>Interfering with or disrupting the App or servers or networks connected to the App.</li>
            <li>Using any automated system, including "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," to access the App in a manner that sends more request messages to the GymSync servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. Our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of these Terms.</p>
        <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may do so through the App's settings or by contacting us. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our App after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Lebanon, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
